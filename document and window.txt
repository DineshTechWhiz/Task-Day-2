JavaScript Document

In JavaScript, the document object represents the web page currently loaded in the web browser. It provides access to the content of the page, as well as methods for manipulating that content.

The document object is a property of the window object and is also a global object in JavaScript, which means that it is available in all contexts throughout your code. You can access it directly using the document keyword.

Below are some examples of common tasks that involve the document object −

    Getting the title of the document: var docTitle = document.title;

    Getting the last modified date of the document: var modified = document.lastModified;

    Getting the body element of the document: var bodyEl = document.body;

    Getting an element by its ID: var el = document.getElementById('my-element');

    Creating a new element: var newEl = document.createElement('div');
